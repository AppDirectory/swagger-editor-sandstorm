# Swagger Editor

Swagger Editor lets you edit [Swagger API specifications](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md) in YAML inside your browser and to preview documentations in real time.
Valid Swagger JSON descriptions can then be generated and used with the full Swagger tooling (code generation, documentation, etc).

This application saves the changes on your sandstorm server so you can use it easily to create APIs.

## 2 Gotchas

1. Multiple people can't edit the content at the same time, they would overwrite each other.
2. The code generation is done by separate online services just like in the online demo.

If these are deal breakers for you, I'm happy to take contributions which would resolve those issues :)
